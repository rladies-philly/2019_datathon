# How to get involved

If you weren't able to attend our [Kick-off Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/258401863/), here's how to get involved:

1. Take a look at [these slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oF49gP7p644qOZNmmhsNr2wc7_pV4vvXbwCbLfhN8sQ/edit?usp=sharing) introducing the project.
2. Take a look at the [github repo](https://github.com/rladiesPHL/2019_datathon) for the project. Read the [readme](README.md)!
3. If you don’t already have one, create a [github account](https://github.com/join) (see our [github workflow recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m0dXQvt7U4bR6Zie3VlwKv25idZW-MbiLxJV2uG9q7I/edit?usp=sharing)).
4. If you haven’t already, install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R-Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) on your computer.
5. If you haven’t already, join the [R-Ladies Philly slack](http://bit.ly/join-rladies-slack).
    + In the R-Ladies Philly slack, join the **#paws** channel (to join channels in slack, click on the *channels* title in the left side bar).
6. Add your details under the team you want to join in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EzzVXFIJ-_KdAwprpDXTcC0G8VYxp6nCOKoZnskgEII/edit#heading=h.46g28hd7gts9). Don't worry about group size; the more the merrier!
7. Join your team’s specific slack channel (listed in the google doc above) and introduce yourself to your team members! :smiley: Share your ideas or ask how you can get started.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch. Send a message in the **#paws** slack channel or email the organisers (philly@rladies.org)!
