## Dataset Overview and Questions  

### Data Generation Process and Some Notes / Questions   
_(based on notes from meeting, may be innacurate)_

  * __Applications:__ `dog_apps.csv` and `cat_apps.csv`  
    * filled out and submitted online  
    * applications range from `r min(mdy(apps_raw$date_submitted))` to `r max(mdy(apps_raw$date_submitted))`
        * _Note: may not be enough data for timeseries/seasonal approach_
    * every one needs to be triaged by PAWS staff, can we help automate its or make it easier somehow?  
    * Every application should have a card associated with it (cards are auto-generated with an online application)
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: some applications have no `outcome_trello_id`, does ths mean they do not have a card associated with them? if so, how can we tell the outcome? May need to remove these applications__  
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: some `outcome_trello_id`'s appear twice (see Appicaitons section below, or id = `5bfecbeaf9c3e187eb632753` for example), are these duplicates?__

<br>      
    
  * __Cards:__ `cat_cards.csv` and `dog_cards.csv`   
    * keeps track of last state of the application via `label_names` column
    * cards range from `r min(cards_raw$dateLastActivity)` to `r max(cards_raw$dateLastActivity)`  
        * _Note: cards seem to include data before the min application date, so maybe not all rows will not be necessary_  
    * data is 1 row per id  
        * _Note: Can have multiple labels per id, keep in mind when trying to categorize an application as successful or not_ 
    * based on the definition in the codebook, `dateLastActivity` should match the max `date` for the corresponding id in the `actions` data
        * _this does not hold for id = `5bfecbeaf9c3e187eb632753`_
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: It seems like when `dueComplete == TRUE`, it means the app was marked complete and there should be a corresponing date in `due`, but there are 6 records with blank dates where `dueComplete == TRUE`__
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: On the flipside, it seems like when `dueComplete == FALSE`, it means the app was not marked complete and they lost contact with applicant. In this case there should not be a corresponing date in `due`, but there there 4,290 records with completed application dates where `dueComplete == FALSE`__  
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: It seems like some cards can be labelled with "adopted"" even though `dueComplete == FALSE`, see id = `5bfecbeaf9c3e187eb632753` for example__
    
<br>

  * __Actions:__ `cat_actions.csv` and `dog_actions.csv`  
    * actions are things done to the cards
    * actions track of the application process via the checklist columns & associated time stamps
    * the `data.checkItem.state` column indicates the action taken for the given column at the specified date time 
      * the action is modifying the column to either complete or incomplete
    * When the `type == createCard`,  `data.checkItem.state` is always `NA` b/c the card is only being created at this step
      * since all columns will be FALSE when `type == createCard`, it  may make sense to split this data set into `type == createCard` for the card create date only, and `type == updateCheckItemStateOnCard` to get only the actions done after card was created
        * may want to compare the `date` entry for the `type == createCard` data set to the `dateLastActivity` entry in the cards data to get the application time frame
      * may want to check that when `type == createCard` the `date` is the same as the `date_submitted` in the applications data for each corresponding ID
    * _Note: Can have multiple rows per id (1 for each action taken on the card)_
    * __<span style="color:red">Question</span>: Why doesn't every `data.card.id` in the `actions` have a `createCard` type variable? some have it and some don't?__

<br>

  * __A Weird Example Case__
    * ID = `5bfecbeaf9c3e187eb632753` has a lot of weird things going on
        * 2 seemingly different apps are associated with this ID in `apps_raw` data set
        * seems like this ID in the `cards` data set was a successful adoption, __but__ has no entry date in `due`  and `dueComplete == FALSE`
        * the `dateLastActiviy` in the `cards` data set does not match the max date in `actions` data set
        * seems like there weren't any actions taken in the `actions` data for this ID, but based on the `cards` data for this ID, seems like a successful adoption 

<br>

### Data Model

Based on the codebook and looking over the data, it seems the data sets are related in the following way:  

  * `apps` joins to `cards` on `outcome_trello_id = id`  
  * `cards` joins to `actions` on  `id = data.card.id`  
  * `apps` joins to `actions`on  `outcome_trello_id = data.card.id` (but probably won't need to join these 2 directly)  

## Check for duplicates and missing data

```{r missing_dups}
#applications
missing_app_ids <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(is.na(outcome_trello_id))

dup_app_ids <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id)) %>%
  group_by(outcome_trello_id) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 1)

#cards
missing_card_ids <- cards_raw %>%
  filter(is.na(id))

dup_cards <- cards_raw  %>%
  filter(!is.na(id)) %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 1)

#actions
missing_action_ids <- actions_raw %>%
  filter(is.na(data.card.id))

dup_actions <- actions_raw  %>%
  filter(!is.na(data.card.id)) %>%
  group_by(data.card.id) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count > 1) 

missing_dups <- data.frame("Missing App IDs" = nrow(missing_app_ids), 
                          "Missing Card IDs" = nrow(missing_card_ids), 
                          "Missing Action IDs" = nrow(missing_action_ids),
                          "Duplicate App IDs" = nrow(dup_app_ids),
                          "Duplicate Card IDs" = nrow(dup_cards),
                          "Duplicate Action IDs" = nrow(dup_actions))

kable(missing_dups)
```

Seems like there are 276 applications with no `outcome_trello_id`, and 35 applications with duplicate `outcome_trello_id`. The 6,578 duplicate action IDs are expected since that data set contains 1 row per action and a card can have multiple actions taken on it.

## Check data model assumptions 

checking a few things that can impact the data when joining these data sets  

  1. check that every unique `application` (that has an ID) has a corresponding `card`  
  2. check that there is at least 1 record in the `actions` data set for every `card `  
  3. check that the application `submit_dt` is the same as the date the `createCard` action was taken (for those cards that have `createCard`)  
  
```{r}
#check every unique application, that has an ID, has a corresponding card
app_card_check <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id)) %>%
  select(outcome_trello_id) %>%
  unique() %>%
  left_join(., cards_raw, by = c("outcome_trello_id" = "id")) %>%
  #these are all the cols in `one_row_per_action`, so if theyre all NULL then there's no corresponding entry
  filter(is.na(dateLastActivity),
         is.na(dueComplete),
         is.na(due),
         is.na(animal_type),
         is.na(label_names)
         )

nrow(app_card_check) # 6 apps with no card
```


```{r}
#check that there is at least 1 record in the actions dataset for every card
one_row_per_action <- actions_raw %>%
  select(data.card.id, date, type) %>%
  group_by(data.card.id) %>%
  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>%
  filter(row_num == 1)

card_action_check <- cards_raw %>%
  left_join(., one_row_per_action, by = c("id" = "data.card.id")) %>%
  #these are all the cols in `one_row_per_action`, so if theyre all NULL then there's no corresponding entry
  filter(is.na(date),
         is.na(type),
         is.na(row_num))

nrow(card_action_check) # 2839 cards with no actions
```


```{r}
# check that the application `submit_dt` is the same as the date the `createCard` action was taken (for those cards that have `createCard`)
created <- actions_raw %>%
  filter(type == "createCard") %>%
  select(type, date, data.card.id) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

unique_apps <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id)) %>%
  select(outcome_trello_id, date_submitted) %>%
  unique()

date_check <- created %>%
  left_join(., unique_apps, by = c( "data.card.id" = "outcome_trello_id")) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(date_submitted))) %>%
  mutate(date_check = ifelse(mdy(date_submitted) == as.Date(date), 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(date_check == 0)

nrow(date_check) # 407 cards with different create dates from the application submit date, which date should we use for the application timeframe?
```


## Applications

### Application volume by month
```{r}

apps_raw %>%
  mutate(date_submitted = lubridate::mdy(date_submitted),
         month = lubridate::floor_date(date_submitted, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month, animal_type) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = count/sum(count))  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = count, fill = animal_type, label = scales::percent(freq))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "monthly application volume") +
  geom_text(size = 3, position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))

```


### Visualizing duplicate applications
```{r}
#create dataset with only duplicate apps
dup_apps <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(outcome_trello_id %in% dup_app_ids$outcome_trello_id) %>%
  group_by(outcome_trello_id) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number())

#most dups are people applying twice. 3 people have applied 3 times
hist(dup_apps$id)
```


## Cards 

### Method for splitting cards into separate rows based on label names  

might be needed for categorizing an application as successful or not. Also might be a good way to see if there is some common reasons why applications aren't successful.

```{r}
split_cards <- cards_raw %>% 
    mutate(label_names = strsplit(as.character(label_names), ",")) %>% 
    unnest(label_names) %>%
     mutate(label_names = trimws(label_names),
            #renaming "adopted elsewhere" so regex can ID successful adoptions easier
            label_names = ifelse(label_names == "adopted elsewhere", "elsewhere", label_names))

#create some application outcome categories
adopted <- c("adopted", "adoption follow up")
mgr <- "manager decision"
ready <- c("approved", "ready to adopt", "ready for review", "reviewed with handouts only", "approved with limitation")
not_adopted <- c("denied", "withdrawn", "do not follow up", "red flag", "serial no show", "elsewhere")
adopted_elsewhere <- "elsewhere"
vet <- c("vet", "vet check in process", "need vet info", "need roommates vet info")
pet_issues <- c("not utd", "questions", "not s n", "dog meet")
more_info_needed <- c("need to see id", "need info", "needs app attached", "rescue check", "checks")
housing_landlord <- c("pet policy", "need written ll permission", "opa", "need proof of ownership", "landlord")

#assign labels to category
split_cards <- split_cards %>%
  mutate(label_names = trimws(label_names)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(category = case_when(
    grepl(paste(adopted, collapse = '|'), label_names) ~ "adopted",
    grepl(paste(adopted_elsewhere, collapse = '|'), label_names) ~ "adopted elsewhere",
    grepl(paste(mgr,collapse = '|'), label_names) ~ "manager",
    grepl(paste(not_adopted,collapse = '|'), label_names) ~ "not_adopted",
    grepl(paste(ready, collapse = "|"), label_names) ~ "ready",
    grepl(paste(vet,collapse = '|'), label_names)  ~ "vet",
    grepl(paste(pet_issues,collapse = '|'), label_names)  ~ "pet_issues",
    grepl(paste(more_info_needed, collapse = '|'), label_names)  ~ "more_info_needed",
    grepl(paste(housing_landlord, collapse = '|'),label_names) ~ "housing_landlord",
    TRUE ~ 'other'
  ))

kable(head(split_cards, 15))


```


## Actions

### Method to collapse actions into 1 row per id  

This will replace the `TRUE` cell entries with the `date`, and put `NA` for the `FALSE` cell entries. Then it collapses the dataset so there is 1 row per ID, with the time stamps each action took place. The only issue with this is that loses information regarding the `data.checkItem.state`, now we can't tell if the action was to mark it complete or incomplete. Might need to re-work this.

```{r collapse_actions}

actions_collapsed <- actions_raw %>%
  filter(type != "createCard") %>%
  #group_by(data.card.id) %>%
  #mutate(first_date = min(date)) %>%
  #ungroup() %>%
  group_by(data.card.id) %>%
  mutate(row_number = row_number()) %>%
  select(-c(checklist_seq_num, row_number)) %>%
  mutate(checklist_ACCT = ifelse(checklist_ACCT == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_CHQ = ifelse(checklist_CHQ == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_LL = ifelse(checklist_LL == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_PP = ifelse(checklist_PP == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_SPCA = ifelse(checklist_SPCA == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_TR = ifelse(checklist_TR == T, as.character(date), NA),
         checklist_VET = ifelse(checklist_VET == T, as.character(date), NA)
         ) %>%
  select(-date) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(na.locf(., na.rm = FALSE, fromLast = FALSE))) %>%
  filter(row_number()==n()) %>%
  ungroup()

kable(head(actions_collapsed, 15))

```


## Looking into Successful/Unsuccessful Apps
```{r combine}

#get list of IDs where adoption was successful
successful_ids <- pets %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "Adoption") %>%
  pull(outcome_trello_id)

#create indicator based on those IDs and check distribution: ~ 75% of apps in the sample are unsuccessful 
apps_raw <- apps_raw %>%
  mutate(successful = ifelse(outcome_trello_id %in% successful_ids, 1, 0)) 

apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id)) %>%
  group_by(successful) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = count / sum(count))
```

possible analysis idea - why are so many unsuccessful? can we ID what part of the process apps get caught up? if so we can inform PAWS where they can provide applicants w/ extra support/materials (i.e. vet info)  

```{r}
#checking proportions of successful/unsuccessfuly between cats/dogs: cats about even, dogs overwhelmingly unsuccessful (only about 12% of dog apps are successful in the sample)
non_blank_apps <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id))

prop.table(table(apps_raw$successful[!(is.na(apps_raw$outcome_trello_id))],
                 apps_raw$animal_type[!(is.na(apps_raw$outcome_trello_id))]), 
           margin = 2)
```

given the large disparity, maybe dog applications have the largest potential for improvement? It seems like a lot of the unsuccessful dog apps were approved and ready...


```{r}

#get labels for unsuccessful dog apps
unsuccessful <- apps_raw %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id))%>%
  filter(animal_type == "dog") %>%
  filter(successful == 0) %>%
  left_join(., cards_raw, by = c("outcome_trello_id" = "id"))

unsuccessful %>% 
  group_by(label_names) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(10)

```


**What is the time spent on successfull vs unsuccessful apps?**   
Could have some missing data issues here since we define the timeframe as card create date, and there are many cards with no `createCard` row

possible analysis idea - processing apps take a lot of time, can we quickly flag an app?  

```{r}

create_card <- actions_raw %>%
  filter(type == "createCard")

apps_raw <- apps_raw %>%
  left_join(., create_card, by = c("outcome_trello_id" = "data.card.id")) 

timeframe <- apps_raw %>%
  left_join(., cards_raw, by = c("outcome_trello_id" = "id")) %>%
  mutate(timeframe = difftime(dateLastActivity, date, units = "days"))

timeframe %>%
  filter(!is.na(outcome_trello_id)) %>%
  group_by(successful, animal_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_days = mean(timeframe, na.rm = T))
  

```

## Ideal Dataset
just my initial thoughts, interested in the approach others are thinking of as well!

 * Would be at the application level (1 row per application)
 * Needs outcome ID (in order to join to other datasets)
 * Would have a card assocoated with each app in order to have a label associated with each app
 * need a `createCard` date in the actions dataset
 * needs all action checklist items in 1 row
 * Includes sucessful adoption indicator
