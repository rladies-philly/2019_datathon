       fill = "animal type") +

         "mean adoption time" = "mean(adoption_time)",
         "median adoption time" = "median(adoption_time)")
```

<br />

Can see that, in general, cat applications typically take longer than dog applications. 

The boxplot also illuminates that many cat applications take significantly longer than dog onesâ€”the upper quartile of cat applications take between about 35 days to 70 days, compared to about 18 days to 40 days for dogs.

**Timeline by Animal & Site**

I assumed that the outcome_sitename (or the location from where animal left PAWS) would get at the "PAWS location" aspect in question 1. I'm not totally sure that the outcome site is where most of the application process occurred, but it's what I'm using for "location" in this analysis.

Here are some visualizations that I tossed together. 

```{r adoption animal & site boxplot, echo=T}
# boxplot of adoption_time by animal & adoption location
masterapps_20190324 %>%
  drop_na(outcome_sitename) %>%                                                         # one id with no adoption site, drop that id
  filter(!adoption_time < 0) %>%                                                        # remove negative values in adoption_time column
  
  ggplot(aes(x = outcome_sitename, y = adoption_time, fill = animal_type)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4, outlier.alpha = 0.1) +                                      # break out checklist_item by cat & dog
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 200, by=20)) +                                     # set y axis tick intervals at 2

       y= "days between app submission & adoption",
       fill = "animal type") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,                                          # title formatting (center, bold, padding)
                                  line = 15, 
                                  face = "bold", 
                                  margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 25, l = 0)),        
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20, r = 0, b = 5, l = 0)),      # x axis title formatting (padding)
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 20, b = 0, l = 5))) +    # y axis title formatting (padding)
  coord_flip()                                                                          # flip the x and y axes

  theme(legend.position = "none",                                                        # remove legend
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),                                                  # remove tick marks on both axies
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,                                           # title formatting (center, bold, padding)

```

<br />

Overall, median adoption times were higher at PAWS Foster Program & PAWS Offsite Adoptions locations. This is especially true for cat applications at those locations. 

Based on median values, here are the fastest & slowest time-to-adoption sites:

* **Cats**
    + Slowest: PAWS Foster Program
    + Fastest: Grays Ferry Avenue
* **Dogs**
    + Slowest: PAWS Foster Program
    + Fastest: PAC

## Checklist Timeline Analysis

I isolated the data to just applications that resulted in adoption. 

```{r checklist days boxplot outliers, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
# days distribution boxplot, by checklist_item & animal
masterapps_20190324 %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "Adoption") %>%
  gather(checklist_item, value, checklist_ACCT:checklist_VET) %>%                        # flatten checklist rows into one column (called "checklist_item") and corresponsding values into one column (called "values")

  ggplot(aes(x = checklist_item, y = value, fill = animal_type)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4, outlier.alpha = 0.1) +                                       # break out checklist_item by cat & dog
  theme_light() + 
  ggtitle("Day Count Distribution by Checklist Item") +
  labs(x = "checklist item",                                                             # set plot labels
       y= "days from last checklist item",
       fill = "animal type") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,                                           # title formatting (center, bold, padding)
                                  line = 15, 
                                  face = "bold", 
                                  margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 25, l = 0)),        
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20, r = 0, b = 5, l = 0)),       # x axis title formatting (padding)
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 20, b = 0, l = 5))) +     # y axis title formatting (padding)
  coord_flip()                                                                           # flip the x and y axes
```

<br />

The outliers make it a little difficult to analyze this plot, so I made it again with fewer outliers. 

<br />
```{r checklist days boxplot, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
#  REMOVED SOME OUTLIERS; days distribution boxplot, by checklist_item & animal
masterapps_20190324 %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "Adoption") %>%
  gather(checklist_item, value, checklist_ACCT:checklist_VET) %>%                       # flatten checklist rows into one column (called "checklist_item") and corresponsding values into one column (called "values")
  
  ggplot(aes(x = checklist_item, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = animal_type), alpha = 0.4, outlier.alpha = 0.1) +             # break out checklist_item by cat & dog
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, by=2),                                         # set y axis tick intervals at 2
                     limits=c(0, 20)) +                                                 # set y limit to 16 to "remove" highest outliers & see plots better 
  theme_light() + 
  ggtitle("Day Count Distribution by Checklist Item (Fewer Outliers)") +
  labs(x = "checklist item",
       y= "days from last checklist item",
       fill = "animal type") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5,                                          # title formatting (center, bold, padding)
                                  line = 15, 
                                  face = "bold", 
                                  margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 25, l = 0)),        
        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 20, r = 0, b = 5, l = 0)),      # x axis title formatting (padding)
        axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 20, b = 0, l = 5))) +    # y axis title formatting (padding)
  coord_flip()                                                                          # flip the x and y axes
```

<br />

Interesting to note that there was only 1 checklist_ACCT item, and only cat applications involved checklist_SPCA items. It's also interesting that I even had to take measures to remove some of the outliersâ€”there are many of them. I wonder what potential labels may lead to certain ones taking longer to complete than others. I didn't get to explore that here, but I think that would be a valuable follow-up analysis. Becasue while the median time for checklist items to be completed is quite low for each, there are certainly enough outliers to wonder what has delayed those applications. 


I also thought it might be more valuable to visualize this information in another way. 

<br />

```{r checklist formattable, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}
# isolate the data that is related to checklist items for adoptions
checklist_calcs <- masterapps_20190324 %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "Adoption") %>%
  gather(checklist_item, value, checklist_ACCT:checklist_VET) %>%
  drop_na(value) %>%
  group_by(checklist_item) %>%
  summarize(mean(value),
            median(value)) %>%
  rename("mean_days_from_last_item" = "mean(value)",                           # rename the df columns to be more readable
         "median_days_from_last_item" = "median(value)") 

# get the count of each checklist item occurrence
checklist_count <- masterapps_20190324 %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "Adoption") %>%
  gather(checklist_item, value, checklist_ACCT:checklist_VET) %>%
  drop_na(value) %>%
  group_by(checklist_item) %>%
  count(checklist_item)

# combine the calculations with the n for each checklist_item
checklist_df <- merge(checklist_count, checklist_calcs, by = "checklist_item", all.x = TRUE) 

# put the table into formattable
formattable(checklist_df, align =c("l","c","c","c"), list(
  `Indicator Name` = formatter("span", style = ~ style(color = "grey",font.weight = "bold")),
  `n`= color_tile("white", "white"),
  `mean_days_from_last_item`= color_tile("#FFEFDB", "#FF8000"),
  `median_days_from_last_item`= color_tile("#FFEFDB", "#FF8000")))
```

<br />

With this table we can see the summary calcs for each checklist item a little more clearly. I also added an "n" column with the number of applications that had this item checked off (had a day since last item value present). This is helpful in understanding how the n size may affect mean/median values. 

One main takeaway is that checklist_ACCT & checklist_SPCA are often not checked off. These correspond to:

* *checklist_ACCT*: Check with ACCT (Animal Care and Control Team)
* *checklist_SPCA*: Check with SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)

Why are these items typically left unchecked? Are they not always necessary for an application (it would seem not)? Our very very small n suggests that these items take longer than the othersâ€”is that why they are not required items? Are there other components of an application, like red flags or animal information, that would lead to this item needing to be completed? 

Can also see in the visualization below that those two checklist items were only completed at the PAC site. Why is that? In any case, I think it's hard to assess these two checklist items.  


```{r checklist heatmap, echo=T, message=F, warning=F}

Otherwise, most application items take between one and two days (median). There isn't too much noticeable distinction between the site or the animal, but it does generally take *slightly* longer for cat applications to have items checked off then for dog ones. This could contribute to cat applications taking longer to end in adoption. Checklist_VET was the item with the greatest differnce between cats and dogs.
